              "Like all Olympic boxing events, the competition is a straight single-elimination tournament. The competition begins with a preliminary round, where the number of competitors is reduced to 16, and concludes with a final. As there are fewer than 32 boxers in the competition, a number of boxers will receive a bye through the preliminary round. Both semifinal losers are awarded bronze medals.\\nBouts consist of three three-minute rounds with a one-minute break between rounds. A boxer may win by knockout or by points. Scoring is on the \"10-point-must\" system, with 5 judges scoring each round. Judges consider \"number of blows landed on the target areas, domination of the bout, technique and tactical superiority and competitiveness.\" Each judge determines a winner for each round, who receives 10 points for the round, and assigns the round's loser a number of points between 7 and 9 based on performance. The judge's scores for each round are added to give a total score for that judge. The boxer with the higher score from a majority of the judges is the winner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              11\n",

A total of 98 quota places are allocated to women's gymnastics.\\nThe 12 teams that qualify will be able to send 4 gymnasts in the team competition, for a total of 48 of the 98 quota places. The top three teams at the 2018 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships (the United States, Russia, and China) and the top nine teams (excluding those already qualified) at the 2019 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships (France, Canada, the Netherlands, Great Britain, Italy, Germany, Belgium, Japan, and Spain) earned team qualification places.\\nThe remaining 50 quota places are awarded individually. Each gymnast can only earn one place, except that gymnasts that competed with a team that qualified are eligible to earn a second place through the 2020 All Around World Cup Series. Some of the individual events are open to gymnasts from NOCs with qualified teams, while others are not. These places are filled through various criteria based on the 2019 World Championships, the 2020 FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Cup series, continental championships, a host guarantee, and a Tripartite Commission invitation. \\nEach of the 98 qualified gymnasts are eligible for the uneven bars competition, but many gymnasts do not compete in each of the apparatus events.\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic delayed many of the events for qualifying for gymnastics.

Florida-born practitioner Aliyah Shipman secured a spot in the women's welterweight category (67 kg) with a top two finish at the 2020 Pan American Qualification Tournament in San José, Costa Rica. The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee blocked her from participation on the grounds that athletes need three years to change the country they represent, and she fought for the United States one year before. Shipman tried to appeal, backed by the Haitian Taekwondo Federation, on the condition that junior athletes do not fall under the same waiting period, but it fell through, so her spot was awarded to another American, Lauren Lee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",
